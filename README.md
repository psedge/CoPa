# CoPa
##Small python app for secure messaging

Co(py)Pa(ste) was originally intended as a way to communicate small bits of text across a network. The plan to implement this in IMCP
was realised to be quite short considering most public networks or internal firewalls block IMCP traffic. Hence, transport methods are
abstracted, and can be extended / altered as necessary.
